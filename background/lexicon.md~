- #### BPF Byte Code:
Often, the BPF virtual machine and the BPF bytecode are sometims referred to interchangably. BPF bytecode is an instruction set which       
is interpreted by a compiler for execution in the kernel. It can be precompiled or interpreted with a JIT. Some Linux distrobutions, in 
a post spectre world require the latter for security reasons.

- #### BPF Virtual Machine:
The following is the most concise explanation I've read yet, from Brendan Gregg's book reference on the top level README.md, "While BPF
is often called a virtual machine, that only describes its specificaiton. Its implementation in Linux (its runtime) has an interpreter
and a JIT-to-native code compiler. The term _vitrual machine_ may imply that there is another machine layer on top of the processor, but
there isn't. With JIT compiled code, instructions run directly on the processor just like any other native kernel code."

- #### JIT:
Just in time compiler or JIT is a compiler which is used at runtime to compile bytecode to machine instructions versus precompiling the
entire instruction set of a program. See the [Wikipedia article on JIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) for more.
