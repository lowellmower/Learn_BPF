- #### BPF Byte Code:
Often, the BPF virtual machine and the BPF bytecode are referred to interchangably. BPF bytecode is an instruction set which can be
interpreted by the kernel for execution. It can be precompiled or interpreted using JIT. Some distrobutions, in a post spectre world
require the latter for security reasons.

- #### JIT:
Just in time compiler or JIT is a compiler which is used at runtime to compile bytecode to machine instructions versus precompiling the
entire instruction set of a program. See the [Wikipedia article on JIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) for more.
