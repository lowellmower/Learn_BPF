## Background, Vernacular, and Lexicon

This section is intended to give a reasonable level of depth and breadth to establish our BPF learning on
top of. I imagine this seciton to be a continued work in progress which will be added to and emmended as
necessary. For the immediacy however, this section will provide some common terminology and background so
that we may have shared language to discuss and explore BPF and the surrounding ecosystem.
