# Learning Objectives

The learning objectives for this project were originally proposed in [a thought dump on my personal site](https://lowellmower.com/2020/02/learn-bpf).

This project will mainly cover four major learning objectives:
1. Background, terminology, ecosystem, and academic topics
2. Expirimentation with existing tooling and frontends
3. [The breakable toy](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/apprenticeship-patterns/9780596806842/ch05s03.html)
4. Useful tool and/or Open Source Project
